Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects, collaborating with diverse teams and clients. These experiences have not only honed my technical abilities but also sharpened my communication and problem-solving skills.</p>

          <p className='text-3x lg:text-5xl mt-5'>Technologies I use</p>
          <p className='text-gray-400 text-xs md:text-sm mt-5'>I am a junior frontend developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Strapi, Firebase, and other related technologies. With HTML, I structure the content of web pages, ensuring a well-organized layout. CSS allows me to define the appearance and layout of elements, bringing designs to life. JavaScript enables me to enhance interactivity and handle dynamic functionality on websites. </p>
          <p className='text-gray-400 text-xs md:text-sm mt-5'>I also work with React, building reusable and modular components, managing state efficiently, and creating dynamic user interfaces. Additionally, I utilize CSS frameworks such as Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap to expedite development and maintain a consistent design system. For navigation and seamless user experiences in single-page applications, I use React Router DOM. To manage global state efficiently, I employ the Context API. </p>
          <p className='text-gray-400 text-xs md:text-sm mt-5'> When it comes to data fetching and handling HTTP requests, I rely on Axios. With Git, I ensure version control and collaboration in my projects. Moreover, I have a foundational knowledge of UX/UI design principles and utilize Adobe XD and Figma for wireframing and creating visually appealing designs. Furthermore, I have experience working with Strapi, a headless CMS that enables me to build customizable and content-rich applications. Additionally, I leverage Firebase for real-time databases, application hosting, and user authentication. With this wide range of technologies and skills, I am excited to create exceptional web experiences that are both functional and visually appealing.</p>
